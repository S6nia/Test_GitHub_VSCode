# Test_GitHub_VSCode
Testing: Cloning from GitHub using VS Code.

It worked. I was able to clone a repository from GitHub to my local machine, and push the changes to the remote repository. All this using VS Code.
(And also listening to Rachael Yamagata :) )

I almost forgot, I had an issue at first!
I got this error: error setting certificate verify locations CApath: none

Then I looked for a solution...
I tried this: git config --global http.sslverify "false"

And it worked! Thank you programmersought.com! :)

Oh, another thing that I've remembered!
I've noticed that when using VS Code, we don't need to create a folder locally beforehand as when using the Git Extensions tool. I still need to double check this. Although it will take a while cause I've been having problems in using Git Extensions... Another experience to be told at another time :)

Good evening to whoever is on that side! Hehe :)
Bye for now! 

Oh, here I am again! :)
I did not understand the last commit... I did not merge, at least intentionally!

Also, I observed another thing: There was a commit performed by another me, I mean by another account of mine... I'm too tired to explain... All I want to do is cooooding! 

Here is a screenshot:

Now, it's time to eat! A developer got to eat! :)
